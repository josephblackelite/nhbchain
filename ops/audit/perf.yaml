description: >-
  Captures latency and throughput targets for ledger write paths under synthetic load, and
  measures consensus finality latency while replaying governance apply transactions.
checks:
  - name: Voucher ingestion throughput
    target: tests/perf
    expect: Ledger insertions remain below 5ms median latency under benchmark load.
  - name: Consensus finality latency
    target: tests/perf
    expect: Governance apply commits maintain p95 finality latency within the configured SLA
      at approximately 1,000 tx/min synthetic load.

      Inspect the p95_ms and p99_ms fields to confirm governance finality latency remains
      within the production SLA once the environment enables the full consensus stack.

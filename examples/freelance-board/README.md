# Freelance Board

The freelance board is a Next.js reference app for milestone marketplaces and retainers. It mirrors the scenarios captured in
[`docs/examples/freelance-board.md`](../../docs/examples/freelance-board.md) and focuses on deterministic data structures rather
than production APIs.

## Getting started

```bash
cd examples/freelance-board
npm install
npm run dev
```

Refer to the documentation for the milestone engine roadmap, example RPC payloads, and the event keys to monitor when
connecting to devnet: [`docs/examples/freelance-board.md`](../../docs/examples/freelance-board.md).

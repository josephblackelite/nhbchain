# Wallet Lite

Wallet Lite is a client-side demo that exercises the NHB identity flows:

* Register a username against a bech32 address via `identity_setAlias`.
* Create claimable escrows for usernames or emails with `identity_createClaimable`.
* Claim escrowed funds using the alias preimage or a verified email hash.
* Compose QR codes that encode `znhb://pay` intents.

The demo targets static hosting and only stores private keys in memory. It is suitable for
walkthroughs and automated test accounts; do not connect production keys.

## Getting started

```bash
# Install dependencies from the examples workspace root
cd examples
yarn install

# Launch the Wallet Lite dev server
cd wallet-lite
yarn dev
```

The server reads RPC settings from the repository root `.env` file:

* `NHB_RPC_URL`
* `NHB_RPC_TOKEN`
* `NHB_CHAIN_ID`
* `IDENTITY_EMAIL_SALT`
* `APP_PUBLIC_BASE` (used for metadata URLs)
* `NHB_WS_URL` (optional, reserved for future realtime updates)

For static deployments set `APP_PUBLIC_BASE=https://nhbcoin.com` so absolute links resolve correctly.

## Flows

1. Paste or generate a throwaway private key. Wallet Lite derives the NHB bech32 address locally.
2. Register a username. The API route adds the bearer token and calls `identity_setAlias` on
   `NHB_RPC_URL`.
3. Create a claimable payment. Choose between alias, email, or raw preimage recipient types. The
   API computes the salted email hash before invoking `identity_createClaimable`.
4. Claim the funds. Provide the claim ID and either an alias (auto-derived preimage) or an explicit
   preimage returned by the identity gateway.
5. Generate a `znhb://pay` QR code for sharing.

## Security considerations

* Bearer tokens and salts are read only on the Next.js server runtime. They are never exposed to the
  browser.
* Private keys remain in React stateâ€”refreshing the page clears them. Do not store real credentials
  in the demo UI.
* Email addresses are hashed with the configured salt before they leave the server.

# Governance Parameters

> Include function-level documentation for developer integrations and technical specs; docs must be generated into /docs/governance/* for auditors, investors, regulators, and consumers.

The following parameters are governable by default. Governance payloads must
respect the validation guidance for each key; values outside the documented
range are rejected during execution. All parameters are community-controlled via
open voting and should be interpreted as configuration levers, not investment
contracts. Adjustments do not create an expectation of profit and should be
considered in light of the risk notes below.

| Key | Description | Validation Guidance | Risk Notes & Disclosures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gov.deposit.MinProposalDeposit` | Minimum deposit required to submit a proposal. Held in escrow to deter spam. | Unsigned integer in Wei. Must be non-negative and less than total supply to avoid overflow. | Deposits are anti-spam bonds only. They are returned or partially slashed per policy and never accrue yield or profit participation. |
| `gov.tally.QuorumBps` | Minimum participation (turnout) required for a proposal to be valid. | Integer basis points `0`–`10,000`. Runtime rejects values above `10,000`. | Low quorum may allow low-participation changes; high quorum can stall governance. Communicate changes to stakeholders before adoption. |
| `gov.tally.ThresholdBps` | Approval threshold for yes votes relative to active votes (yes + no). | Integer basis points `0`–`10,000`. Must be >= `5,000` to avoid trivial approvals. | Raising the threshold increases safety but may slow emergency responses. Lowering below 2/3 should include rationale and mitigation plan. |
| `gov.timelock.DurationSeconds` | Delay between proposal queueing and execution. | Unsigned integer seconds. Must be >= network minimum (default 86,400) and < 30 days to prevent overflow. | Short timelocks reduce review windows; long timelocks delay urgent fixes. Announce changes widely to integrators. |
| `potso.weights.AlphaStakeBps` | Proportion of POTSO rewards attributed to validator staking weight. | Integer basis points `0`–`10,000`. Values above bounds are rejected. | Adjusting weight influences validator incentives but does not guarantee return. Communicate redistributive effects to delegators. |
| `potso.rewards.EmissionPerEpochWei` | ZNHB emission allocated per epoch for POTSO incentives. | Unsigned integer in Wei. Must be `>= 0` and `< 9.22e18` to avoid overflow. | Higher emissions increase circulating supply and may dilute holders. Include monetary impact analysis when changing this value. |
| `fees.baseFee` | Minimum base fee charged for network transactions. | Unsigned integer in Wei per gas. Must be non-negative; typical range `0`–`1e15`. | Fee adjustments are for network sustainability. They do not represent revenue sharing and should be accompanied by usage impact notes. |
| `slashing.policy.enabled` | Toggles the on-chain slashing engine. | Boolean `true` or `false`. | Disabling slashing pauses treasury debits from evidence processing. Communicate mitigation plans before re-enabling. |
| `slashing.policy.maxPenaltyBps` | Maximum penalty applied per infraction in basis points. | Integer basis points `0`–`10,000`. | Higher caps increase deterrence but amplify downside risk for operators. Document rationale and thresholds. |
| `slashing.policy.windowSeconds` | Rolling window used to enforce slashing penalties. | Unsigned integer seconds between `60` and `2,592,000` (30 days). | Very short windows can miss repeated behaviour; long windows may extend incident response timelines. |
| `slashing.policy.evidenceTtlSeconds` | Maximum age of evidence accepted by the slashing module. | Unsigned integer seconds `>= windowSeconds` and `<= 7,776,000` (90 days). | Ensures stale evidence cannot trigger penalties indefinitely. Align TTL with compliance retention policies. |
| `slashing.policy.maxSlashWei` | Cap on the slash amount routed from treasury per infraction. | Unsigned integer in Wei `>= 0` and `< 9.22e18`. | Sets an upper bound on treasury exposure for any single event. Keep aligned with risk appetite and reserve levels. |
| `staking.minimumValidatorStake` | Minimum self-bond required for a validator to be eligible for selection. | Positive decimal integer in Wei representing ZNHB; governance may not set `0` or negative values. | Defaults to `1,000` ZNHB during migrations to ensure continuity. Raising the floor tightens validator admission and may reduce decentralisation; lowering it can increase validator set churn and affect selection fairness based on stake-weighted rotation. |
| `global.staking.AprBps` | Target APR expressed in basis points used to advance the reward index each payout cycle. | Integer `0`–`2,000` (0%–20%). Runtime enforces the bounds; values above 1,250 bps (12.5%) should include justification and downstream communication. | Adjusting APR impacts expected rewards but does not guarantee return. Lower APRs reduce emissions; higher APRs draw from the emission cap sooner. Communicate rationale to delegators and include a monetary policy note. |
| `global.staking.PayoutPeriodDays` | Interval between reward snapshots and distribution cycles. | Unsigned integer `>= 1` and `<= 90` days. Runtime rounds fractional input. | Shorter cycles increase operational load and treasury flow variance; longer cycles delay cash realisation for delegators. Share any schedule changes with integrators and dashboards. |
| `global.staking.UnbondingDays` | Cooling-off period before undelegated stake becomes liquid. | Unsigned integer `>= 1` and `<= 90` days. | Longer unbonding periods improve security but raise liquidity risk for participants; shorter windows should include monitoring upgrades to detect churn. |
| `global.staking.MinStakeWei` | Floor on the amount a delegator or validator must stake to participate. | Positive decimal integer in Wei; empty strings default to `1`. | A very low minimum (default `1`) keeps the network open to small holders. Raising the floor can reduce spam but increases barriers to entry—consider messaging to affected wallets. |
| `global.staking.MaxEmissionPerYearWei` | Hard cap on rewards minted per calendar year across all delegators. | Unsigned integer in Wei `>= 0` and `< 9.22e18`. | Reaching the cap stops new rewards until the next cycle or a governance update. Increase only with treasury buy-in and document the inflationary impact. |
| `global.staking.RewardAsset` | Token symbol used when emitting staking payouts. | Uppercase ASCII string matching a supported asset (default `ZNHB`). | Changing the reward asset requires wallet and accounting coordination. Communicate symbol updates to exchanges, custodians, and explorers. |
| `global.staking.CompoundDefault` | Whether newly accrued rewards auto-compound for delegators. | Boolean `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false` when unspecified. | Auto-compounding increases exposure to staking returns but may have tax or accounting implications. Provide opt-out instructions before enabling by default. |
| `global.pauses.Staking` | Master switch for staking state transitions (delegate, undelegate, claim). | Boolean `true` or `false`. | Pausing halts new transitions but keeps existing unbonds and indexes ticking. Always publish an incident note before toggling to `true`, and plan for a resumption vote. |
| `staking.payoutIntervalSeconds` | Interval between reward index advancements and payout windows. | Unsigned integer `>= 86,400` and `<= 3,153,600` (1–36 days). | Shorter intervals increase operational overhead and may stress RPCs; longer intervals delay cash flow and can surprise delegators. Any change should reference updated documentation and dashboard alerting. |
| `staking.rewardIndexScale` | Scaling factor applied to the reward index to preserve precision. | Positive integer power-of-ten recommended (default `1e18`). Must be `>= 1` and `<= 1e24`. | Setting the scale too low reduces precision and causes rounding drift; too high can overflow in client libraries that use 64-bit integers. Coordinate with SDK maintainers before changing. |
| `staking.maxEmissionPerYearWei` | Hard cap on rewards minted in a calendar year across all delegators. | Unsigned integer in Wei `>= 0` and `< 9.22e18`. | Reaching the cap stops new rewards until the next year or until governance raises the limit. Increase only with treasury buy-in; document the inflation impact. |
| `staking.pause.enabled` | Master switch for staking state transitions (delegate, undelegate, claim). | Boolean `true` or `false`. | Pausing halts new transitions but keeps existing unbonds and indexes ticking. Always publish an incident note before toggling to `true`, and plan for a resumption vote. |

# Testnet Explorer Capabilities

The public explorer surfaces real-time testnet state for validators, developers, and auditors. Use this guide to verify launch-critical metrics and teach new developers how to navigate the interface.

## URLs

| Surface | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Web App | <https://explorer.testnet.nhbcoin.net> |
| Validator Dashboard | <https://explorer.testnet.nhbcoin.net/validators> |
| API | `https://explorer.testnet.nhbcoin.net/api` |
| WebSocket | `wss://explorer.testnet.nhbcoin.net/ws` |

Bookmark the status page at <https://status.testnet.nhbcoin.net> for maintenance alerts and indexer lag notifications.

## Core Features

* **Block View** – Inspect headers, proposer addresses, voting power, and evidence of byzantine behavior.
* **Transaction Inspector** – Decode messages for swap, escrow, identity, POTSO, governance, and staking modules.
* **Account Pages** – Track balances, delegation state, and escrow locks per address.
* **Validator Monitoring** – Review uptime, commission, missed blocks, and jailed status.
* **Search & Filters** – Query by address, transaction hash, block height, or governance proposal ID.
* **Verification Panel** – Upload signed messages to verify ownership and display validator websites.

## Developer Workflow Checklist

1. Fund an address via the [faucet](./faucet.md) and confirm the transaction is indexed.
2. Submit swap and escrow transactions, then validate message decoding in the transaction inspector.
3. Register an identity and avatar; ensure the explorer displays the alias and metadata.
4. Submit a POTSO offer and track lifecycle events under the "Services" tab.
5. Participate in governance voting and review tallying updates in real time.
6. Use the API to fetch `/api/blocks/latest`, `/api/txs/<hash>`, and WebSocket `newBlock` subscriptions as part of integration tests.

## Verification How-To

1. Navigate to the validator detail page.
2. Click **Verify** and upload the signed JSON file generated by `nhbchaind tx staking edit-validator --generate-only`.
3. Confirm the explorer validates the signature and displays the verified badge and website URL.
4. For identity accounts, use the signature tool on `/verify` to bind social proofs.

## Operational Monitoring

* Subscribe to WebSocket streams for `validatorStatus` and `governanceUpdates` to feed community dashboards.
* Export the API metrics (`/metrics`) into Prometheus using the provided service monitor manifest.
* Validate the explorer cache purge pipeline before launch to avoid stale data after governance parameter changes.

## Troubleshooting

* **Missing Transactions** – Check indexer lag on the status page. If lag exceeds 2 blocks for 5 minutes, execute the cache purge runbook.
* **Incorrect Balances** – Resync the explorer's LCD mirror by restarting the `explorer-sync` deployment.
* **API Rate Limits** – Apply for partner access tokens for sustained traffic above 50 requests/second.
* **Verification Failure** – Ensure the JSON file is signed with the current validator consensus key and not an old rotated key.

# Security Program Overview

We operate a coordinated vulnerability disclosure program to keep NHBChain participants safe.

- **Bug bounty:** Learn about scope, reward tiers, and response targets in [`docs/security/bug-bounty.md`](docs/security/bug-bounty.md).
- **Responsible disclosure:** Reporting instructions, SLAs, and embargo expectations are documented in [`docs/security/disclosure.md`](docs/security/disclosure.md).
- **Audit readiness:** External assessors can access frozen commits, build steps, and fixtures via [`docs/security/audit-readiness.md`](docs/security/audit-readiness.md).
- **PGP key:** Our repository key and fingerprint live in [`docs/security/repository-pgp-key.asc`](docs/security/repository-pgp-key.asc).

To report a vulnerability, encrypt your findings with the repository PGP key and email `security@nehborly.net`. For urgent issues, escalate via Signal at `+13234559568`.
